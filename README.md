This is a sales data from the online shopping website, recording orders data in the United States with 21 columns as below:

The data also includes a sub-table named “people”, showing the regional manager information:

In this ‘Sales dashboard’, I designed three KPI to track: Sales, Profit, and Quantity. It shows the total current year’s sales, profit, and quantity, together with the increased percentage compared with last year (Year-Over-Year Change). Alongside with the number, trend lines are presented for better visualization.

The graph ‘Sales and Profit Distribution by States’ give a clear look on which state has relatively large sales and profit. I also add ‘Top 10 States Sales / Top 10 States Profit’ to make a quick detection.

Monthly [Total Current Year Sales/Profit/Quantity] by segment allows users to click ‘Select a Parameter’ and see monthly measurement in each segment. This is an area chart, and average sales/profit/qty and largest sales/profit/qty are marked in the graph.

Graph ‘Total Sales by location and manager’ used the information about regional manager, and compare their performance.

In the dashboard, a filter allows users to click ‘region button’ in the left-bottom, and see how other graphs changing with different regions (west, east, central and south). A highlight also allows users to hover around the U.S. map, and directly have a sense which region it belongs to.
